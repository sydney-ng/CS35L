Laboratory: 
1. to download Coreutils 7.6 do wget 
ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz 
2. I unzipped the file of Coreutils by using 
tar -xzvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz 
3. You then want to go to the coreutils-7.6 folder so 
you use the command cd coreutils-7.6. 
4. I then ran ./configure, make, and make install to
 set up coreutils. Configure is an executable script 
that will match the libraries & dependencies on your 
computer with the ones needed by the code. It will 
find the Makefile.ln and turn it into Makefile Make
 will go into the Makefile (that was generated by 
configure) and execute all of the commands that are 
there. Make install will put the files into the correct 
locations on your local computer. 
5. You change the LC_ALL to en_US.UTF-8 by using export 
LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8. This will create the problem that we
 will fix with the patch. en_US.UTF-8 is the Unicode 
locale that uses UTF-8 as its code set. 
6. In the top level folder, I created a file called “fix” 
that will have the patch in it. To create, I used touch 
fix and vim fix. I copied the information from the URL 
given for the patch into fix. 
7. To execute the patch, use patch -p0 < fix. I used -p0
 because I wanted to keep the full directory of the patch. 
8. Use the command make to recompile the Makefile. It will
 go into each of the directories, make the files in that 
directory, and then exit. If there is nothing to do make 
in that directory, it will exit.

9. Type in ls -l /bin/bash to check if it has worked. 
10. I created a new file using vim test patch and ran touch –t 201401210959.30 testpatch on it. I then did ls -l to check the format and it is correct.
