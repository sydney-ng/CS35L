1. In file included from utimecmp.c:41:
utimens.h:2: error: conflicting types for 'futimens'
/usr/include/sys/stat.h:374: note: previous declaration of 'futimens' was here
make[2]: *** [utimecmp.o] Error 1

2. Apply the patch:  patch -p0 < ../../coreutils.diff 
3. ./configure --prefix=/u/eng/class/classyng/Desktop/Laboratory/Week4/CoreUtils_Stable/coreutils-with-bug
4. touch -d '1918-11-11 11:00' temp.c and ls -lt
5. gdb ls: the way to access that executable in src (otherwise 
you would be pulling it from the bin, which you can't do) 
6. You then want to run gdb to see where the logic error is. 
You want to look at files that pertain to time. In particular,
 when you go into compare m_time with gdb, you can see that
 the function timespec_cmp is subtracting to get the time. 
Instead, you should have the function return -1, 0, or 1 --
 a foolproof way to ensure that you are getting a valid 
response each time. 
7. We then edit the function and then save it as a patch
 file called timespecPATCH.h. Then apply the patch the 
same way we did above, but change the diff file name from 
coreutils.diff to lab4.diff. 
8. When you reproduce the problem in your directory in 
SEASnet Linux servers and you try to test it, the problem
 is not fixed. The original problem continues to persist with the wrong date order.
