1. First you want to run the command, sort --version.
 This will give you the following output:

2. Create a file with 10,000,000 single-precision floating point numbers.
To do this, use the command od -An -t f -N 40000000 <dev/urandom | tr -s ' ' '\n' > test.txt.
od: dumps files in octal
-An: don't write offset base
-t: specifies the type
f: floating point (goes with type)
-N: tells you the number (goes with 1000000)
4000000: size of the file, in terms of bytes
dev/null: where to put the extraneous error stuff
tr -s ' ' '\n': turn ' ' into '\n'
> test.txt: put this output into test.txt
3.  export PATH=/usr/local/cs/bin:$PATH will allow you to change your path
environment variable.
4. time -p sort -g test.txt > /dev/null is used to time.
The following is the output:
real 19.17
user 18.78
sys 0.03 
4. Then you want to use --parallel so you use:
   a. time -p sort -g --parallel=1 test.txt > /dev/null
        real 91.00
        user 90.85 
        sys 0.14 
   b. time -p sort -g --parallel=2 test.txt > /dev/null
        real 48.01
        user 91.37
        sys 0.18
   c. time -p sort -g --parallel=4 test.txt > /dev/null 
        real 27.42
        user 93.31 
        sys 0.22
   d. time -p sort -g --parallel=8 test.txt > /dev/null 
        real 17.98
        user 95.37
        sys 0.26
